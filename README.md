# Machine Learning Operations

When deploying machine learning models, it is useful to create portable, efficient code that can be automated. Using Docker and popular languages R and Python, I am creating trainable models using Docker and Amazon Web Serivices. These examples are recreated from existing resources with credit attributed.

## PyMLops: A Complete Guide for Docker Beginners

This is a Github repostitory following along Tina Bu's [Build a Docker Container with Your Machine Learning Model](https://towardsdatascience.com/build-a-docker-container-with-your-machine-learning-model-3cf906f5e07e) to create a Docker instance in AWS. This is a beginner example of how to use AWS and Python to train a machine learning model.

## RMLops: A simple R example for Azure Pipelines

This is the Github repository associated with this Azure Pipelines project: https://dev.azure.com/davidsmi0786/davidsmiRtest. It is intended as a simple example
of using R with Azure Pipelines to use a CI/CD process to trigger training of a
predictive model.
